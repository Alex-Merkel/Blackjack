# Blackjack

## Project Description

An engaging and immersive Blackjack game brought to life through a blend of powerful technologies. This project utilizes Flask and Python for the server-side logic, while JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS work harmoniously to create a dynamic and visually stunning gaming experience.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Card Display:** Utilizes card images dynamically to visually represent gameplay and display both dealer (only 1 card showing at first) and player hands.
- **Responsive Design:** Images are configured to adjust and scale based on different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, including mobile.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
- https://github.com/Alex-Merkel/Blackjack.git:
- cd Blackjack

2. Install the required Python libraries:
- pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

### Backend (Flask):

**Start the Flask Server within a Virtual Environment:**

   - First, create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate   # For Unix/macOS
     .\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
     ```
   
   - Install required dependencies if not installed:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   
   - Start the Flask server:
     ```
     flask run
     ```

**To effectively use the budgeting platform, follow these steps:**

1. Select 'Start Game'
2. Choose bet amount (you start with 100 chips and it must be an even whole number) and hit 'Select Bet Amount' to lock in your bet
3. You will see your cards at the bottom of the screen and one of the dealer's cards at the top. Your score and chip amount will be on the right and the dealer score will be to the left.
4. Decide if you would like to get another card by selecting 'Hit' or if you want to stay with your hand by selecting 'Stand'
5. You will see the result of the game and are given the option to play again by selecting 'Play Again'
